# Resource Repository

## Development

### Dependencies:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- Docker (incl. Docker Compose, which already part of Docker for Mac and Docker Toolbox)
- Yarn

### Setup

Setup yarn
```
yarn install
```

Builds the docker image, sets up environment variables, and adds nicer a local hostname:
```
yarn run setup
```

Optionally set a password for postgres by updating the value for `DEV_PASS` in your `.env` file.

### Starting and stopping the stack

Start the stack:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
Or (to poll for the env to start and open a new tab):
```
yarn start
```

Stop the stack:
```
docker-compose down
```
Or (to also gracefully close the tunnel)
```
yarn stop
```

The app is available at: https://local.resources.teachcomputing.org

### View logs

View logs (add -f to tail, and/or append a container name such as 'web' to tail only that container):
```
docker-compose logs
```
For example
```
docker-compose -f logs web
```

### Database

The database is automatically setup the first time the container is run, and a migration is performed on each subsequent run.

#### Reset the database

Since the setup is run via rails it's easiest to bring the entire stack down.
```
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```

You can also target the db volume with the following, however you'll need to bring the web container down and up again too.
```
docker-compose rm -sv db
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Run migrations

To perform migrations manually (without restarting the container) run:
```
docker-compose run --rm web bin/rails db:migrate
```

####Â Seeding the database

To seed manually run:
```
docker-compose run web bin/rails db:seed
```

### Install new Dependencies

Add the dependency to the Gemfile or package.json and run:
```
docker-compose down
docker-compose build
```

## Testing

Uses [rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec)
```
docker-compose run --rm web bin/rspec
```
Or
```
yarn test
```

To use [guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) to watch the tests:
```
docker-compose run --rm web bin/guard
```
Or
```
yarn run guard
```

## Tooling

### ERB Lint

Used for linting ERB / HTML files

Run with `bundle exec erblint --lint-all`

https://github.com/Shopify/erb-lint

### Reek

Used for detecting 'code smell' in your app.

Run with `bundle exec reek`

### Brakeman

Used for static code analysis to check for potential security flaws.

https://brakemanscanner.org/docs/quickstart/

We are ignoring some of the warnings using the method described in the [Brakeman docs](https://brakemanscanner.org/docs/ignoring_false_positives/) We are using the default location for the ignore file, etc.

Run `brakeman -i config/brakeman.ignore .` in the project root and follow the onscreen prompts, outlined in the above doc, to use the tool and check the output for warnings, etc.
